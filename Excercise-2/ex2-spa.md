# Excercise 2 : single page application

We need you to build us a small single page application to manage class.

You are free to use whatever technologies you want from this [vuejs](https://vuejs.org/), [nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org/), [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)

## How we want it to work

- We need to be able to create the class and receive a confirmation message of its success (or failure)
- Create one detail page of an class in that we can able to see the list of classes in table or list view
- We need to be able to remove a class

## APIs

In the [class](./class/) directory, you can find a couple of class.
You can assume these are in the format of the real external API.
For now, you can use this dummy data, but make sure we can plug in the real api in easily.

In the [data](./data/) directory, you can find source files for school data and student data, in case you need it.
You can assume these are in the format of the real external API.

To create the class, just log it on the console, but make sure we can plug in the real api endpoint easily.

_NOTE: In this coding exercises you have to read/ add/ modify data using JSON file not using an array variable._
